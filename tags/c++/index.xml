    <description><![CDATA[My little ray tracer project has had a few improvements since my last post at the start of the year so I thought it would be good to do a new post on the progress.

    <description><![CDATA[My implementation of Chapters 1-15 of The Ray Tracer Challenge book by Jamis Buck. Implemented in C++ and compiled to WebAssembly.
Just select a scene description from the dropdown (or enter your own according to the style used in the book) and click &ldquo;go!&rdquo; to generate the render.
Let me know what you think. Code is available on my Github. Let me know if you have any tips for me.]]></description>
