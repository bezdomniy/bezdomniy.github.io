      <description>My little ray tracer project has had a few improvements since my last post at the start of the year so I thought it would be good to do a new post on the progress. I have mainly been working on a native version using SDL2 for user input (moving the camera) and presentation. However the web version in my previous post was simply returning a list of RGB values which I would then draw directly to the canvas, and using the left-right buttons for input.</description>

      <description>My implementation of Chapters 1-15 of The Ray Tracer Challenge book by Jamis Buck. Implemented in C++ and compiled to WebAssembly.
Just select a scene description from the dropdown (or enter your own according to the style used in the book) and click &amp;ldquo;go!&amp;rdquo; to generate the render.
Let me know what you think. Code is available on my Github. Let me know if you have any tips for me.</description>
